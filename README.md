# UFOS


# Overview

> The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic web page that displayed UFO sighting data through the use of JavaScript and HTML.

# Results

> Through JS we can allow users to filter data from the back-end and display onto a web page.\ Users can type in the suggested placeholder elements as the filters, the result returns 2 matches. Make sure to type everything in lower case letters and do not have spaces at the end of the text. Click off the input box or press enter to initiate the filter. To reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website. Just as a side note I changed the color and the animation of the filter button because I can! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

# Summary:

> The app runs smoothly however you have to write specific instructions in the search bar to get a result. Some shapes might not be as obvious. The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. The city that was used.

# Recomendations:
> A filter on a date range might be preferable than a singular date. Also adding a counter on the top of the page that gives you the number of results that pops up would be nice.
